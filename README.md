> Traveling Salesman Problem solved with Genetic Algorithms in CS454, KAIST, 2019 Fall

This repository is enhancement on the coursework in CS454. A meta-heuristic approach to Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), with Genetic Algorithms. 

## About TSP

> More information about the problem can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). 

## About the Code

Due to high computation cost, classical optimization algorithms such as Greedy Search are not effective in large problem instances. 
There's currently no known single best algorithm for TSP, and various stochastic optimizations are proposed to effectively get acceptable solutions!
We will be implementing for several approaches as follwings: 

Greedy, 2-Opt, Genetic Algorithms, Ant-Colony Optimization(ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)

and more: [Lin-Kernigan Heuristic](http://www.akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/), [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/gui/gui.htm)
